# prompting-101

Getting started with prompting and engineering with LLMs.

## Example workshop

- Introduction to the workshop or course
- Mentimeter and other prep
- Introduction to AI (symbolic vs discriminative vs generative) and LLMs (how are they trained?)
- Chat applications and hallucinations (hands on)
- Get everyone up and running with the API, see [Notebook 1](notebooks/1-Intro-to-LLM-development.ipynb)
- Using the API, trying some things, and a bit about tokens, see [Notebook 2](notebooks/2-Prompt-engineering.ipynb)
- More stuff: tools or functions, agents, embeddings, and RAG; see [Notebook 3](notebooks/3-Developing-solutions.ipynb)

If this is for an idea jam or hackathon, then you can continue:

- Brainstorming applications (about 45-60 minutes)
- Forming projects and teams (about 45-60 minutes)
